{"name":"Libmnl","tagline":"Mirror of https://git.netfilter.org/libmnl/. ","body":"= What is libmnl? =\r\n\r\nlibmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.\r\nThere are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of\r\nboth the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.\r\nThis library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code\r\nand to avoid re-inventing the wheel. The main features of this library are:\r\n\r\n* Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.\r\n* Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that\r\ntend to hide Netlink details.\r\n* Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.\r\nIt provides functions to make socket handling, message building, validating,\r\nparsing and sequence tracking, easier.\r\n* Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction layer\r\non top of this library.\r\n* Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the library\r\nis reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the programmer is not\r\nforced to use them.\r\n\r\n= Example files =\r\n\r\nYou can find several example files under examples/ that you can compile by\r\ninvoking `make check'.\r\n\r\n--\r\n08/sep/2010\r\nPablo Neira Ayuso <pablo@netfilter.org>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
